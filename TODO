> Implement the path variable
    implies the splitting of the PATH variable
    then scanning every path in that variable for
    the sought after executable
    then executing that executable

> Optimize PATH variable handling
    Right now the general logic and idea is there
    However I need to clean up the code and re-implement a more modular version of 
    the PATH variable handling

> Refactor
    Put/copy the envv variable into the shell to make the code cleaner

> pair every malloc with a free
    I have prepared plenty of TODOs for this
